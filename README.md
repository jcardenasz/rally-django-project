This repository has a little example of DJANGO usage, using django rest framework. It consists on a rally API that has its own vite-react frontend. The purpouse of this project is academic, to learn how to use Django and to explore its estructure at usage, using a really interesting topic that i am passionate about: Rally. The information into the api may not be historically accurate.
